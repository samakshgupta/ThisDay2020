                        It’s safe to say that no matter who you are, or where you are, you will remember this time forever — how you
                        spent months on end mostly indoors, as the world outside completely changed. It’s been a tough time, no doubt,
                        but there have been glimmers of hope and moments of happiness, and little things that made it memorable and helped
                        you get through it all. Maybe you reconnected with some old friends, maybe you learnt how to fix yourself an edible
                        meal, or maybe you discovered new things about yourself.

                        We hope that <strong>This Day 2020</strong> can be your digital keepsake of the time you lived
                        through a global pandemic and emerged on the other side, a changed person. We want you to have a place to go to —
                        years later, when you’re sitting around a dinner table with friends or sitting by the window with a cup of coffee —
                        to remind yourself of all you did, thought and felt during this weird time in 2020, when we all were trying
                        to make sense of a global pandemic.

                <p class = "text-left">Once you sign up, you will be asked a question every two days, about your experience of
                    living through this pandemic — some thoughtful, some provocative, and some silly.</p>
                <p class = 'text-left'>You are free to answer as many questions you want to, but once a new question has been
                    shared with you, you will be unable to go back and answer a question you have missed.</p>
                <p class = 'text-left'><strong>This Day 2020</strong> has been created as a time capsule, and none of your information is shared with anyone,
                    except you, and future you, whenever it is <strong>you choose</strong> to receive your answers - be it a few months, a year or
                    even three.</p>
                <p class = 'text-left'>The team that put this together will have access to this information, but none of your data will be shared publicly. </p>
                <p class = 'text-left'>This project has been set up as a six month
                    experiment, and will stop collecting data after 31st March, 2021. </p>
